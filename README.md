# Flight Interruption Simulator due to Natural Disasters
 An A-Level Computer Science NEA


I am erupting volcanoes and seeing which flights would be interrupted

## How it works:
1. User enters Volcano
2. Program looks up information about said volcano in a stored database
3. Program uses a Weather API to lookup wind speed and direction at said location
4. Program calculates disrupted 'no-fly zone'
5. Program uses a Flight Tracker API to see which flights are in or will be in no-fly zone
6. Program returns information about said flights
